In order to run the simulation open the command prompt go to the correct directory, which is where project3.
and project3.h are.

Once that is accomplished, run the command: "make"

After that run the command: ./project3 [options]
You can also choose the run the command without "[options]"

Options are just a tracelevel and a file input for a given distance matrix with a number of nodes.
If you choose not to include options it will ask you to enter a trace level
